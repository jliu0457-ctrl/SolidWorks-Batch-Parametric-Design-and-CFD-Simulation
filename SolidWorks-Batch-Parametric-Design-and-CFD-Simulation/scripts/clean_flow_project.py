"""Remove every inherited Flow Simulation project from an assembly and save it.

Usage:  python clean_flow_project.py <assembly.SLDASM>

Why: the V7 template carries a Flow project inherited from the original hand-built model.
Its boundary conditions reference faces on the four caps.  Once a dimension change moves those
caps the references stop resolving, and the next rebuild raises a MODAL dialog
("面<1>@封盖1<1> 未在固体和流体区域之间的边界上") that blocks every later COM call.  Every
parameterized run is capless and removes the project anyway, so the template is better off
without it - and a clean template means the dialog can never fire.
